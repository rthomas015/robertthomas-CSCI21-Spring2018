Question #15.2.1: Suppose the words in the sentence "Madam, I'm Adam." were pushed one after the other
onto the same queue, and then they were printed as they were popped off. What would be printed?
    Madam, I'm Adam.
 
    
Question #15.1.2: What will the (eventual) program do in general to any sequence of words?
    Print each one as they are input into the queue (so basically print out the sentence given word by word).
  

Question #15.2.3: What is the behavior of this program?
    To take in information (a string) and output each word recursively in the order they were received.


Question #15.2.4: What are the objects needed in the program?
    ifstream, cin, queue, string


Question #15.2.5: What are the operations needed in the program? Similar to Experiment #1, you can ignore the old, familiar input/output operations.
    file input, looping through the file, inputting information into the queue,  looping through the queue, console output,


Question #15.2.6: What is the algorithm for this program?
    ...skipping file opening etc...
    while (haven't reached end of input file)
        read in from file
        push into queue
    loop
    
    while (queue is not empty)
        output first value in queue
        delete first value in queue
    loop

Question #15.2.8: How does FIFO explain the behavior you see from your program?

    The first information into the queue was the first information output from it.
